## Bugtracker

Bugtracker is a simplified bug tracking system where users can report bugs without the need to be logged in. It also includes a few administration tools for managing the reported bugs. Special thanks to [WoWEmu](https://wowemu.org).

## Requirements

To use Bugtracker, make sure you meet the following requirements:

1. PHP 7.5 or higher (PHP 8 is recommended).
2. MySQL or MariaDB database server (MySQL is recommended).
3. Apache web server with mod_rewrite enabled and properly configured for URL rewriting.
4. If you're using Linux, ensure that your directories have appropriate permissions (`.env` file will need `755` permissions).

## Setting up .env

To take advantage of the `.env` file, follow these steps:

1. Create a `.env` file in the `bugtracker/engine/` directory.
2. Copy the contents from `example.env` into `.env`. Alternatively, you can rename `example.env` to just `.env`.

## Serving to the web

You can serve Bugtracker to the web using one of the following options:

1. [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/)
2. [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
3. [LAMP](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-20-04)
